# Environment Isolation Strategy

## Environment Architecture

### Development Environment
- **Purpose**: Local development and feature testing
- **Infrastructure**: Docker Compose on developer machines
- **Database**: Local PostgreSQL with sample data
- **Security**: Minimal security for development speed
- **Access**: All developers with VPN access
- **Data**: Synthetic test data only

### Staging Environment
- **Purpose**: Pre-production testing and client demos
- **Infrastructure**: AWS ECS Fargate (single AZ)
- **Database**: RDS PostgreSQL (single instance)
- **Security**: Production-like security with test certificates
- **Access**: Development team + stakeholders
- **Data**: Anonymized production-like data

### Production Environment
- **Purpose**: Live healthcare marketplace
- **Infrastructure**: AWS ECS Fargate (Multi-AZ)
- **Database**: RDS PostgreSQL Multi-AZ with read replicas
- **Security**: Full HIPAA-compliant security stack
- **Access**: Operations team only with MFA
- **Data**: Real patient data (PHI)

## Security Controls by Environment

### Development
```yaml
Security Level: Basic
- Local SSL certificates
- Basic authentication
- No data encryption at rest
- Local logging only
- No audit trails
- Development API keys
```

### Staging
```yaml
Security Level: Enhanced
- Valid SSL certificates
- JWT authentication with short expiry
- Database encryption at rest
- Centralized logging (CloudWatch)
- Basic audit trails
- Staging API keys with rate limits
- Network isolation (VPC)
- Security group restrictions
```

### Production
```yaml
Security Level: Maximum
- EV SSL certificates with HSTS
- Multi-factor authentication
- End-to-end encryption
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Real-time security monitoring
- Production API keys with strict limits
- WAF protection
- DDoS protection
- Intrusion detection
- Compliance monitoring
- Data loss prevention
- Regular security assessments
```

## Access Control Matrix

| Role | Development | Staging | Production |
|------|-------------|---------|------------|
| Developer | Full Access | Read/Write | No Access |
| DevOps | Full Access | Full Access | Deploy Only |
| QA Team | Read Access | Full Access | Read Only |
| Security Team | Audit Access | Full Access | Full Access |
| Operations | No Access | Monitor Only | Full Access |
| Stakeholders | No Access | Demo Access | No Access |

## Data Classification

### Public Data
- API documentation
- System status pages
- Marketing materials
- **Environments**: All

### Internal Data
- System configurations
- Performance metrics
- Error logs (anonymized)
- **Environments**: Staging, Production

### Confidential Data
- User credentials
- API keys
- Business logic
- **Environments**: Production only

### Restricted Data (PHI)
- Patient medical records
- Personal identifiers
- Payment information
- **Environments**: Production only with encryption

## Deployment Pipeline

### Development → Staging
```bash
Triggers:
- Pull request merge to main branch
- Manual deployment by developers

Process:
1. Automated testing (unit + integration)
2. Security scanning (SAST/DAST)
3. Docker image build and scan
4. Deploy to staging ECS cluster
5. Smoke tests execution
6. Notification to QA team

Approval: Automatic (if tests pass)
```

### Staging → Production
```bash
Triggers:
- Manual deployment by DevOps
- Scheduled releases (weekly)

Process:
1. Full test suite execution
2. Security compliance check
3. Database migration dry-run
4. Blue-green deployment preparation
5. Production deployment
6. Health checks and monitoring
7. Rollback capability

Approval: Manual (DevOps + Security sign-off)
```

## Compliance Requirements

### HIPAA Compliance
- **Administrative Safeguards**
  - Security officer designation
  - Workforce training programs
  - Access management procedures
  - Incident response plans

- **Physical Safeguards**
  - Data center security (AWS responsibility)
  - Workstation security policies
  - Media controls and disposal

- **Technical Safeguards**
  - Access controls with unique user IDs
  - Audit logs and monitoring
  - Data integrity controls
  - Transmission security (encryption)

### SOC 2 Type II
- **Security**: Access controls and network security
- **Availability**: System uptime and disaster recovery
- **Processing Integrity**: Data processing accuracy
- **Confidentiality**: Data protection measures
- **Privacy**: Personal information handling

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Development
- Basic application logs
- Error tracking (Sentry)
- Performance monitoring

### Staging
- Application and infrastructure logs
- Security event monitoring
- Performance and availability monitoring
- Automated testing results

### Production
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Real-time security alerts
- Performance and capacity monitoring
- Compliance monitoring and reporting
- Incident response automation
- Business metrics and analytics

## Disaster Recovery

### Development
- **RTO**: 4 hours
- **RPO**: 24 hours
- **Strategy**: Rebuild from source code

### Staging
- **RTO**: 2 hours
- **RPO**: 4 hours
- **Strategy**: Automated backup restoration

### Production
- **RTO**: 30 minutes
- **RPO**: 15 minutes
- **Strategy**: Multi-AZ deployment with automated failover
- **Backup**: Continuous replication to secondary region
